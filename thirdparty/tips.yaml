general:
  - C4 had 50% more range and damage than stock, and goes through walls!
  - AT4 had 50% more penetration but 25% smaller explosive radius than stock, and goes through walls!
  - Incoming fire has the right of way, do not run in front of another player!
  - Suppressors have no downside in range, accuracy or damage.
  - When shooting out a window, sit 4-5 feet back from the window so you don't create a outline of yourself. (This makes you less of a target and harder for anyone outside to see)
  - When in a fixed position, sit back from the corner, in a dark spot, and try not to move very much.
  - Don't take Support or Specialist unless you can play as a teammate, those roles are important.
  - The M203 is an excellent way to offensively clear an area, it has 40% greater explosive radius than stock!
  - If a soldier is engaging through a doorway, throw grenades over him and be ready to support him.
  - Any grenade usage should be done with someone else covering the door with a rifle.
  - Stand to the side behind corners, make it hard for the enemy to see you and make them walk right towards you.
  - Grenades are the best way to safely clear an area you cannot see, like rooms. Never put your body in a place where a grenade will do!
  - You should always be shooting, moving, or communicating. If you are doing more than one at the same time, you're probably going too fast!
  - Suppression is a very effective tool, any time you are defending against incoming enemies, keep firing at the doorways!
  - HP ammo if you hit limbs, AP if you hit chest or head.
  - Remember, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast!
  - Move fast, and you'll make mistakes. This game does not forgive them.
  - If you are a SAW gunner, you should be firing half the shots for your entire team at the end of the round.
  - As a sniper or DM, don't rush! Stay back and overwatch!
  - Never, ever stand square in a doorway! And never stop in a door!
  - Move in groups of 2-5 to be effective, a lone man is a dead man.
  - Stand back from openings as you look in them, then you can scan it safely.
  - Map knowledge in this game is ESSENTIAL.
coop:
  - Don't run ahead to capture or destroy points just to increase your score.
  - In Survival mode, communication is essential. Check the map, find the closest safehouse, and make sure the whole team heads that way.
  - Don't go prone against bots, they will shoot you in the head more often than not. Mobility is key in coop.
  - Bots CANNOT capture a point on a counterattack, they only contest them. You can leave the point, and clear it to advance to the next objective.
  - Frag grenades in both slots is the most versatile loadout for most players. And you can pick up another explosive!
  - If the round ends and you still have explosives, you're not being aggressive enough with them.
  - The laser will attract bots like a moth to a flame. Great for support and overwatch distractions.
  - When in PvE, after spawning, spread out from your team mates quickly, so you don't get hit by the RPG.

# Insurgency Data
This repository is the result of my automated tool which reads the game data files and all custom maps I currently support and puts out useful files such as:

* Map overview info
* Theaters and cvars by version
* Textures in native and and PNG format
* Language and resource files

This is created as a place to store any content generated from the game files which is custom to my tool suite, and I try to keep it updated as soon as new releases come out.
